They will be able to assess your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment or further investigations if needed.\\n\\n<Symptom Management>: While waiting for your appointment, you can try to rest your eyes and avoid activities that may strain them, such as excessive screen time or reading in dim lighting. Applying a warm compress to your eyes may also help alleviate any discomfort.\\n\\n<Medication>: Since you did not provide any information about your current medication, it is difficult to provide specific advice in this regard.

This includes eating a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, protecting your eyes from excessive sunlight exposure by wearing sunglasses, and practicing good hygiene to prevent eye infections.\\n\\n<Mental Care>: Experiencing eye-related symptoms can be stressful, and it is important to take care of your mental well-being. Engaging in relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation, may help reduce stress and promote overall well-being.\\n\\n<Preventions and Alerts>: If you experience any sudden changes in your vision, severe eye pain, or any other alarming symptoms, it is important to seek immediate medical attention.
